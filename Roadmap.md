# Development Workflow and Roadmap

## Development Workflow

### 1. **Planning and Setup**

- **Define Requirements**: Finalize the core features and functionality.
- **Setup Repositories**: Create a Git repository for version control.
- **Design Wireframes**: Sketch out user interface designs using tools like Figma or a whiteboard.

### 2. **Backend Development**

- **Initialize Backend**: Set up a Hono server.
- **Configure Supabase**:
  - Create tables for user accounts, anime lists, and admin control.
  - Configure API keys and environment variables.
- **Implement Authentication**:
  - Set up JWT tokens for user authentication.
  - Include role-based access control for users and admins.
- **Integrate External API**:
  - Connect to MyAnimeList or TMDb API to fetch anime details.

  - Login and Registration.
  - Personalized dashboard for users.
  - Admin control panel.
  - Anime search and detailed view pages.
- **Integrate Backend**:
  - Connect the frontend to backend APIs for dynamic data.
- **Implement State Management**: Use context or a state library (e.g., Zustand or Redux) for managing user and anime list data.

### 4. **Testing and Debugging**

- **Frontend Testing**:
  - Write unit tests for components.
  - Perform UI/UX testing.
- **Backend Testing**:
  - Validate authentication flows.
  - Test database queries and API responses.
- **Integration Testing**:
  - Ensure seamless interaction between frontend and backend.

### 5. **Deployment**

- **Frontend Deployment**: Host the React app on platforms like Vercel or Netlify.
- **Backend Deployment**: Host the Hono server on platforms like Vercel or a VPS.
- **Database Hosting**: Use Supabase for database and authentication.

### 6. **Post-Launch**

- Collect user feedback.
- Monitor performance and fix any issues.
- Plan additional features and updates.
